    "\n",
    "You will work on a larger exercise where you will use the tools you learn. In the exercise you will use the logistic regression model, which is fitted on the movie review dataset in the slides to predict sentiments on a completely different dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains tweets about US airlines. You can read more about it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment?resource=download\n",
    "- Each tweet has been classified as positive, negative or neutral, which makes it possible for us to compare the predictions from our logistic regression model with the actual sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to learn the pitfalls of fitting a model to one kind of text data, and then use the model to predict sentiments of another kind of text data (*cross-domain evaluation*). I.e., we will investigate how *generalizable* our model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spoiler: The words in the tweets convey a completely different meaning than the words in the movie reviews, so our movie review logistic regression model is not good at predicting sentiments in tweets."
